# Analysis of Australian Postcodes and GeoJson Data

This repository contains the code and data for the analysis of Australian postcodes and GeoJson data. The analysis is done using Python.

Currently, analysis using this folder has been temporarily stopped. The analysis is being done in the https://github.com/thanhan910/AusGeo repository instead.

## Use cases

You can use this website to search for the location of a subur or postcode in Australia. You can also use it to find its nearby suburbs, postcodes, select them on the map, and download the selected suburbs and postcodes as a csv file. This can be useful if you want to find a list of suburbs and postcodes that you may need to explore when looking for a new place to live or do business.
